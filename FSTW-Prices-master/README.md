<h3>Modifying values</h3>

You can add, remove or modify values in the calculator, by modifying values in the `FSTW_Prices.json` file. It always follows this format:

    {
        "name1":value,
        "name2":value,
        "name3":value,
    }
    
Where `name` is the name of the material, and `value` is the material's relative value, where 0 is worth nothing, and `10` is the value of Sunbeam

Please check that `FSTW_prices.json` is located in the same folder as the exe
